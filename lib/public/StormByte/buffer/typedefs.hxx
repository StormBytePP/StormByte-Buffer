	 * Flags are orthogonal and may be combined with @c operator|.
	 *
	 * - @c Sync (0) — no flags: stages run sequentially on the **caller’s** thread;
	 *   @ref Pipeline::Process blocks until completion.
	 * - @c Async — run work on background thread(s); @ref Pipeline::Process
	 *   returns immediately with the final @ref Consumer.
	 * - @c Parallel — one thread **per stage** (pipeline parallelism via SPSC
	 *   intermediate rings). Without @c Async, @ref Pipeline::Process still waits for all
	 *   stages to finish before returning.
	 *
	 * Typical combinations:
	 * | Expression                    | Stages              | Process()      |
	 * |-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|

	 * | @c Async \| Parallel          | 1 thread per stage  | returns now    |
	 *
