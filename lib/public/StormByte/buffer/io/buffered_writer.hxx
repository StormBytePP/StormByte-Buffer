			 * @brief Coordinated binary write sink with optional chunked write-behind
			 *        and a delayed-seek page map.
			 *
			 * Public base for byte destinations. Leaves implement the
			 * @c Origin* hooks and may override @ref Setup, @ref Seek,
			 * @ref Size and @ref WillWrite. They do not override
			 * @c Write, @c Flush, @c Open, @c Close, @c Rewind or
			 * @c Truncate.
			 *
			 * @par Binary only
			 * Octets only. No text mode.
			 *
			 * @par Session
			 * Construction is @ref State::Unavailable. A successful
			 * @ref Open moves to @ref State::Idle. @ref Close is
			 * idempotent, always @ref Flush then @ref OriginClose, and
			 * returns to @ref State::Unavailable on success or @ref State::Fault if
			 * Flush failed. @ref Open is not idempotent. @c Close then
			 * @c Open is a valid round-trip. Destructor of a leaf must
			 * call @ref Close while the leaf vtable is live.
			 *
			 * @c operator bool is true when @ref State is Idle.
			 *
			 * @par Write
			 * @c Write consumes the whole visible source or nothing
			 * (atomic). @c FIFO is read from the current read position
			 * (@c FIFO::Read is const; the cursor is mutable). The FIFO
			 * / span is left untouched on @ref Status::TryAgain,
			 * @ref Status::Failed and @ref Status::Error.
			 *
			 * @par Lazy write / MaxMemory
			 * Every @c Write is lazy until @ref MaxMemory.
			 * The origin is touched only when dirty pages exceed
			 * @ref MaxMemory (GC), or on @ref Flush / @ref Close.
			 * @c MaxMemory == 0 stores no pages: each @c Write goes to
			 * the origin (and to the ring when both ring knobs are on).
			 *
			 * This is not magic RAM. Local seeks and seeks into a
			 * still-dirty past stay in the map. Distant random writes
			 * need a larger @ref MaxMemory or the farthest-past island
			 * is evicted to the origin (that eviction is real I/O and
			 * may block). A jump far ahead is supported only while it
			 * fits; it is not the typical case. The typical case is a
			 * correction near the write high-water and a seek back to
			 * that front.
			 *
			 * GC evicts the farthest past first, in a contiguous run,
			 * so one @ref OriginSeek covers a cheap sequential push.
			 * Future islands are evicted only when no evictable past
			 * remains.
			 *
			 * A durable-progress ratio is
			 * @c Materialized / HighWater when @c HighWater > 0.
			 * @c HighWater is the maximum logical cursor this session.
			 * @c Tell is the cursor and may sit behind HighWater.
			 * @c Materialized is what the origin already holds.
			 * Do not use @c Accepted or @c Tell as the denominator.
			 * After a sequential session Close,
			 * @c Materialized equals HighWater.
			 *
			 * @par WriteChunk / BackPressure
			 * Either ring knob @c 0 disables the drain pipe.
			 * Both @c > 0 enable an internal SPSC ring used only to
			 * push a GC / Flush / Close run. Capacity is
			 * @c BackPressure * WriteChunk bytes. A @c Write that would
			 * exceed that cap returns @ref Status::TryAgain.
			 * The worker does not empty the page map just because the
			 * origin cursor is aligned.
			 *
			 * Setters take effect immediately. Turning the ring off or
			 * lowering the cap below @ref Dirty flushes dirty bytes
			 * first and may block. Setting @ref MaxMemory does not
			 * Flush and does not resize the ring.
			 *
			 * @par Flush / Truncate
			 * @ref Flush blocks, materialises every dirty page in
			 * offset order (with the @ref OriginSeek calls that need),
			 * drains the ring, calls @ref OriginFlush, and never
			 * returns @ref Status::TryAgain. Flush is not where seek
			 * elision happens.
			 * @ref Truncate drops the map and the ring without pushing
			 * and calls @ref OriginTruncate. @ref Tell, HighWater and
			 * Materialized become 0.
			 *
			 * @par Seek / Size
			 * @ref Seek moves only @ref Tell. It does not call
			 * @ref OriginSeek and does not Flush. Default @ref Seek
			 * fails when the leaf has no usable @ref OriginSeek
			 * (the base hook fails). A file leaf uses the base
			 * implementation.
			 *
			 * Typical correction inside resident dirty pages is O(1)
			 * with respect to the device. A @c Write / @c Seek that
			 * trips GC may block on origin I/O on purpose: random
			 * access on a slow device is more expensive than that wait.
			 *
			 * Default @ref Size is @ref Tell (includes dirty pages).
			 * A file leaf returns max(filesystem size, Tell).
			 *
			 * @par MaxWait
			 * Applies to the next @ref OriginPush (direct @c Write or worker).
			 * @c 0ms waits without limit. The ring itself is not timed.
			 * Setting @c MaxWait does not abort an in-flight push.
			 *
			 * @par WillWrite
			 * Protected probe used by @c Backend::Bridge. Default asks
			 * the ring cap. Leaves may tighten it (disk space, socket).
			 * The answer is indicative: another process, quotas or a
			 * network filesystem can still make the later @c Write fail.
			 *
			 * @par Telemetry
			 * @ref Telemetry copies counters under the coordinator lock.
			 * Accumulators start at construction and do not reset on Close.
			 * @c Materialized and @c HighWater are levels, not accumulators.
			 *
			 * @par Movable, not copyable
			 * Move transfers @c m_io. The worker is not stopped. Moved-from
			 * is Unavailable.
