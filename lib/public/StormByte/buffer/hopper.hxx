	 * @class Hopper
	 * @brief Single-producer single-consumer (SPSC) typed item queue.
	 *
	 * Hopper is a typed bucket queue for passing items between a single producer
	 * and a single consumer. Unlike byte-oriented FIFOs, Hopper operates on discrete
	 * typed elements.
	 *
	 * Key characteristics:
	 * - Capacity ceiling: Optional capacity ceiling (0 = unbounded). Push waits when full.
	 * - EoF handling: Marking Eof signals end of production; queued items can still be drained via Pop.
	 * - Consumer notification: Points to a consumer condition variable via Notify to signal when
	 *   items or EoF are available.
	 * - Item flow: @c hopper << item and @c item >> hopper enqueue; @c hopper >> item dequeues.
	 * - Query: Size, Capacity, Full, Empty, EoF, Ready, Writers, Front (peek, copy).
	 * - Non-copyable, non-movable: Shared via std::shared_ptr.
	 *
	 * @tparam T Item type stored in the queue (must be MoveConstructible).
