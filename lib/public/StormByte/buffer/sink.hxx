	 * @class Sink
	 * @brief Set of Hopper buckets keyed by an integer.
	 *
	 * Sink manages a collection of Hopper queues keyed by an integer (representing
	 * channels, tracks, sessions, etc.). Sink does not interpret the integer key.
	 *
	 * Key characteristics:
	 * - Wiring: @c producer >> consumer shares every existing hopper.
	 *   @c producer.To(key) >> consumer creates or shares one key. When this
	 *   Sink already holds that hopper, dest is a co-writer: Eof on this Sink
	 *   then only closes the hopper when the last writer closes.
	 *   @c consumer << producer and @c consumer << producer.To(key) are the
	 *   same edges. @ref Bind remains for one or two releases and is deprecated.
	 * - Drain: Terminal producer flag. Push to an un-wired key discards the item
	 *   without waiting for a consumer.
	 * - Pop: Retrieves items across buckets using Round-Robin, custom Select,
	 *   or a single key (@ref Pop(int)).
	 * - Query: @ref Keys, @ref Contains, per-key Size/Capacity/Full/Empty/EoF/Ready/Front.
	 * - EoF: Closes the Sink and CloseWriter on hoppers this Sink writes.
	 *
	 * @tparam T Item type stored in the hoppers (must be MoveConstructible).
